## Inkling Coding Exercise

Please implement a simple auto-complete drop down that should filter a list of books as the user types. See `autocomplete-example.gif` for an example of what the final UI could look like, though you may build anything you want.

A simple harness built on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) has been provided, including book data and some basic styling. Feel free to make any modifications you want, to CSS, HTML, or JS.

### Guidelines and Hints

* All the required book data has been provided in `src/books.js`. Book cover images have also been provided in `public/thumbnails` if you choose to use them. You should not need to make any XHR requests.
* Your solution must work in the latest version of Chrome, but you do not need to ensure any additional browser support unless you would like to.
* Feel free to use the Internet, so long as you don't copy anything that solves the problem for you.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.
